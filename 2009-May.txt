Hello!

I've decided to come back to mklivecd, but I have a problem : after 
havin taken the hotplug fonction in the code that does not work under 
Mandriva Linux, I now get the following error :


chmod 644 /tmp/mklivecd.14645/livecd/livecd.sqfs [100.00% 
00:00:00/00:00:00]chmod: ne peut acc?der 
`/tmp/mklivecd.14645/livecd/livecd.sqfs': Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce 
type
DIE
FATAL: Execution of 'chmod 644 /tmp/mklivecd.14645/livecd/livecd.sqfs' 
failed


This is obtained using the latest version of mklivecd. The older 
versions are trash.

I would like to make work mklivecd under Mandriva Linux, if possible. It 
is much easier than Draklive.

Thank you by advance if you have any idea.
