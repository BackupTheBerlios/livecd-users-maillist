Subject: [Livecd-users] ISO compression
Message-ID: <6c20a9110802040326y314ec6a1if810b050443c580d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am the lead developer and team lead at Granular Linux Project (
http://www.granularproject.org/). Granular Linux is a PCLinuxOS based
distro. While making preparations for the next release of Granular, a
thought related to the ISO image compression came to my mind, so just wanted
to discuss that with you.

I was wondering if it is possible to increase the default compression ratio
for the final iso image that is prepared by the (great) mklivecd script?
Say, with 2.1-2.2GB uncompressed (installed) system, one can get a 700MB cd
image, is it possible to get the same 700 MB (approx) CD with 2.3 GB or
greater uncompressed content? If so, could you please guide me through the
procedure to achieve that? Or just point me to the appropriate location to
do the same, I would handle the rest.

Take Care.

hello anurag.
i really can't personally answer your question but this definately is a 
very interresting question that is being investigated by the team 
working on the EEEpc version of pclinux and wich is based @ 
mypclinuxos.com forum...

both xandros and pclinuxos version of linux running on the eee are 
booting in "poor-man" mode wich is kind of helpfull when it comes to 
space. and the pclinuxos team is looking at that very closely and if i 
remember well tries to enhance the compression of the iso to reduce the 
system's footprint.

Ivan keres is the best person to address about that very specific issue 
(i think) in the livecd developers team

all the best for your granular distribution

Pierre-Henri

Thanks a lot for the reply, Pierre-Henri. I'll certainly contact Ivan, as
suggested by you. But how do I contact him? There's not mention of his email
address at his BerliOS profile page.

Nevertheless, I guess my question passes to him through this mailing list.
Ivan, are you there? ;)

i guess he's and will answer you

etrj is working at the very moment on a new compression method, here is 
a quote from jmiahman on pclinuxos addressing the eepclinuxos progress 
in this domain ...

anyway, apart from the pclinuos core developement around mklivecd, there 
is a loot going on at mypclinuxos with scrits for very "wierd and fun 
installs derivated and extanding mklived ... it's cooking and somehow 
boiling ... i think it won't be long before we get some major 
enhancement in the framework!

Wow! The news seems interesting. I do hope that the day is not far away when
you guys would come up with a whole new enhanced (and revolutionized)
mkinitrd script. :)

Message-ID: <6c20a9110802200737v344bff7bl89010f544275642c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

A simple question to the developers of mklivecd again. is it possible to use
the LZMA compression scheme in the mklivecd script, as it is used in the
linux-live script (http://www.linux-live.org/)? If yes, then how? What do
modify in the mklivecd script to get it done?

Link to squashfs lzma website: http://www.squashfs-lzma.org/

Thanks.

hi

as far as i know support for that lzma compression is the focuss point 
of the devs at the very moment ...

but maibe etjr has some more accurate answer to give you !
