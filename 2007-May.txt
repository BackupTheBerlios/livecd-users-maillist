Subject: [Livecd-users] problem with mandriva 2007.1 and mklivecd
Message-ID: <465D8D5B.9040105@lmd.ens.fr>

Hi,

I have a problem with mklivecd and mandriva 2007.1

when I boot with a livecd, I have the messages :

searching for the loop image :    /dev/sdc [DONE]
ERROR: Unable to mount the livecd
Dropping you to a limited shell
loading /initrd/bin/ash
BusyBox v1.1.2 (2006.12.14-05:46+0000) Built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of buit-in commands.
/initrd/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

and my livecd is out

I use the mklivecd from cvs (version 0.6.0-20070530). It's same with
older version.
My kernel : kernel-2.6.17.14mdv-1-1mdv2007.1

What happened ? Doesnt it work with mandriva ?
Thanks a lot for your help

Frederic

my program was built for pclinuxos, should work for
mandriva 2007.1 in theory seeing pclinuxos is based
off  mandriva.

anyway the error seems like a bad burn, did you burn
the iso at low speed, also have you tried to run the
iso with qemu?

I always test iso with qemu before i burn them.

so I don't see why it doesn't work too. I had this problem with cooker 
(devel 2007) but with the cvs new version, it was ok. But now with 
official it doesnt work. May be a problem with the kernel ?

I use vmware and qemu too for testing the iso, and the problem is always 
present. I did not test by burnig the image as long as work not.
