Subject: [Livecd-users] Error: No suitable media for the livecd content found
Message-ID: <6c20a9110812300020p3f983ca7v29efb9481f509e52@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

The preparations for the final release of Granular 1.0 are on, and
currently, the testing phase of the ISO is in progress. During testing, I
found out that booting the ISO results in this error:

Error: No suitable media for the livecd content found.
Workaround: Copy the content of the livecd from your boot device to an
IDE/SATA disk

This is during the booting phase when "linuxrc" routine of mklivecd is in
progress. The error occurs just after the "Probing USB" process gets over.

I checked out the "linuxrc" script for any clues and found out that the
error could be popping up due to the variable "CROM_LIST" being empty.

Does this mean that no CDROM devices are being detected? Could it be that
the usb/ide cdrom drivers are missing, or need to be updated to a newer
version?

What could be the solution to this issue?

Thanks.
