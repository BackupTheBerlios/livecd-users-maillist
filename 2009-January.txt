Subject: [Livecd-users] Help for building an iso for Mandriva 2009.0-based
 distribution.
Message-ID: <4973A365.4000007@gmail.com>

Hello.

I have recently build a light weight system entirely based on Mandriva 
Linux 2009.0, but I have some difficulties and questions.

At first, the system does not contain a lot of programs and components 
(LXDE desktop, and few GTK/Gnome programs) and thought, the livecd is 
still heavy, about 740MB. I would have liked it to be inferior to 700MB, 
but even reducing the number of the components does nothing. The system 
is doing about 2.1GB.
Since it is aimed for old computers, do you think it is possible to make 
it launch the installation process like in the Free edition of Mandriva. 
Old systems are a bit old to launch live mode I think.

Also, it seems it does not find correctly the bootsplash. There no 
bootsplash when launching the CD.

This is the first time I create a LiveCD and mklivecd looks so easy to 
use compared to draklive. Thank you for providing this tool and thank 
you in advance for your help.

NB : The package livecd-utils could not install a perl package. However 
it is installed. Squashfs-utils is also installed.

Thomas Lottmann aka Skiper.

Thomas,

In my opinion, you should try the latest PCLinuxOS version of mklivecd. They
have modified the script to use LZMA compression which is better than the
normal compression used by mklivecd. With LZMA, you can get a 700MB image
for even a 2.3GB installed system.

Get the PCLOS version of mklivecd as a RPM from:
http://spout.ussg.indiana.edu/linux/pclinuxos/pclinuxos/apt/pclinuxos/2007/RPMS.testing/mklivecd-0.7.1-21pclos2007.i586.rpm

Take Care.

Thank you very much. I will tell you the results of my next try.

Just, do you think I should install the squashfs-lzma-kernel packages 
for compression? I have installed it but I don't know if it is really 
usefull.

Sure, install them if you use an older kernel version. I think the newer
kernels come with the lzma support built-in. But I am quite doubtful aboutt
squashfs-lzma kernel module. I think you should install it anyway.

Anurag, I have installed the package you gave me, however I now have a new

Hmm... it seems the distro you are trying to remaster has a little bit
different structure than PCLinuxOS. You could search for a "mklivecd"
version of Mandriva that has lzma support.

Well, the most recent one in the Mandriva's repositories and the one I 
used to install is the following :

        Version : 0.6.0.20081211-0.20081211.2mdv2009.0
        Groue : Syst?me/Configuration/Startup
        Architecture : noarch
        Size : 180 Ko
        Media : Contrib Backports (Official2009.0-12)
        URL : http://livecd.berlios.be/

And the one that is not backported :

        Version : 0.5.9-0.13mdv2009.0
        Group : Systeme/Configuration/Startup
        Architecture : noarch
        Size : 162 Ko
        Media : Contrib (Official2009.0-9)
        URL : http://livecd.berlios.be/

So I don't think they do have lzma support. And they work only when they 
want to.

If you have any further idea...

Well, I searched a bit and found out that there does not seem to exist a 0.7
version of mklivecd for Mandriva. So, I guess you'll have to stick to the
latest PCLOS version for best results.

I think you should put put that first error, which you got using PCLOS's
mklivecd, on PCLinuxOS's forum. That should help.

Thank you. I will do this.

By any chance, do you think that recompiling mklivecd under Mandriva 
could do it? Or making it for Mandriva again in some way?

Well, you could do a diff on the PCLOS mklivecd and the Mandriva
mklivecd and try to resolve some differences in the PCLOS mklivecd to
make it ready for use with Mandriva.

For example, you can start by removing this line from the PCLOS mklivecd:

do_cmd("cp -a $o_root/etc/hotplug $dir/etc",	++$pos);

I think this is the step in the build process that is making it to
fail. You could just remove it or comment it out and see if the PCLOS
mklivecd works for you then.

Hi Thomas,

The latest version of mklivecd for Mandriva is available in the 
backports as version 0.6.0.20081211-0.20081211.2mdv2009.0.

Although it is listed as being version 0.6.0 it is actually an SVN 
checkout of 11th Dec 2008, which is quite recent. There are patches 
applied to make it work with Mandriva 2009. You will need to specify 
"unionfs" on the command line.

Regards,
SimonB

Hi Simon!

Well, I already tried the version you indicated me. It is the version I 
installed, yet with a 2.1GB system, I obtained a 784MO iso image. And 
when it tried to boot in a VM, it acted wild during boot process and 
started an infinite loop. So I think this version is a bit too old for 
Mandriva 2009.0. Looks like it has not been maintained for a while (like 
so many mandriva packages).

I will try tomorrow to edit mklivecd's lines about pclos and take of the 
ones that cause problems, but I hope it will be ok.

Was there someone before who used to maintain the mandriva package? Or 
was it the mandriva team exclusively?

Best regards,
Thomas.

NB : I have posted a ticket (in french) with screenshots of the system I 
really want to build and distribute. If you are curious to see what you 
are helping me for, see 
http://skiperdrake.blogspot.com/2009/01/enfin-des-nouvelles.html for the 
early screenshots. ;-) this is a way to thank you for helping me.

Helo!

I'm sorry but I cannot find the file and its directory to modify it. I 
tried to go into /usr/share/mklivecd, but the files in there had too 
much code lines and I did not find this hotplug stuff.

Thanks.

Thomas.

The PCLOS version of mklivecd gets installed in /usr/sbin/, but I
don't know about Mandriva.

You can just search for the word "hotplug" in the PCLOS mklivecd. I
doubt that hotpulg stuff is present in Mandriva.

I have changed that option. And so... Very good news!  :-)

I finally obtained a new iso again. And the great thing is that is now 
takes only 560MB (compared to 784MB before)!

I am transfering it to another computer to test it on several computers 
and make sure it will boot properly.

Ok. I have tested the LiveCD, and I obtain the following error message :

boot :
could not find kernel image : livecd

What shall I do?

During compression, he aolso was wrong searching gfxboot files at the 
wrong place (he looked at /usr/share/gfxboot/pclinuxos/install instead 
of /usr/share/gfxboot/current) and displayed an error. Where should I 
modify this path?

Hey, great to hear that you finally got the ISO. :)

Yeah, that script, for obvious reasons, uses the PCLOS gfxboot theme
by default. But you can change that by simply using the "-boottheme"
modifier with the command you use to create the ISO.

Issue mklivecd --help to learn more about it.

Thank you. I will try.

But... don't you have any idea about the boot issue? I can't figure it 
out even with mklivecd's help.

Hello!

I am still stuck to one problem :

I tried several times to rebuidld an iso, I looked for help, but no way, 
he does not find any kernel to boot the LiveCD with.

Don't you have any idea? I can't find anything that could solve the issue.

Thank you fr your help.

Thomas.
